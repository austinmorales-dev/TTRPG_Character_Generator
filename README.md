# CHAR-GEN

Char-Gen is a barebones character generator for *most* tabletop RPG systems, written in pure Go. 

Take a look at how it works in action over [HERE!](rpg.austinmorales.dev)

Want to work on your own front-end dev skills? Well you're in luck because *you* can self host this API if you want ðŸ¤ 

To get this running on your own hardware, just make sure you have the latest version of Go installed and run `go build` in the same directory as `main.go`.

It runs on port 9001 by default, but feel free to change it! 

As time goes on, expect more features! 

# Endpoints

`/random` - the only supported endpoint as of v1.0, returns a JSON response with character stats and name.
